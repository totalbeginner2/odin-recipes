    <img src="https://panlasangpinoy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Sinigang-na-Baboy-Recipe.jpg">
    <p>A mix of tender meat, fresh spinach, string beans, and tomatoes, as well as a dash (or more) of savory fish sauce, make for 
        the perfect combination in simmering and incorporating each unique flavor with each other. Powerful and poignant, sinigang is a Filipino native, through and through. 
    </p>
    <p> Its name, sinigang, originates from the Tagalog verb that directly translates to “to stew” — sigang!
        Because of its Tagalog name, many presume it to be Tagalog in origin as well. This yummy meal has relatives in other regions in 
        the country as well, to be sure — yet none are quite like this classic soup that many have fallen in love with.
